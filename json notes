Python JSON: Encode(dump), Decode(load)
------------------------------------------
What is JSON?
---------------
JSON is a standard format for data exchange, which is inspired by JavaScript. Generally, JSON is in string or text format. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation.

The syntax of JSON: JSON is written as key and value pair.

{
        "Key":  "Value",
        "Key":  "Value",
} 

JSON is very similar to Python dictionary. Python supports JSON, and it has an inbuilt library as a JSON.

To perform JSON related operations like encoding and decoding in Python you need first to import JSON library and for that in your .py file,

>>> import json

Following methods are available in the JSON module

Method          Description
------          -----------	
dumps()  	encoding to JSON objects
dump()	        encoded string writing on file
loads()	        Decode the JSON string
load()	        Decode while JSON file read

Python to JSON (Encoding)

Converting Python data to JSON is called an Encoding operation. Encoding is done with the help of JSON library method â€“ dumps()

dumps() method converts dictionary object of python into JSON string data format.
